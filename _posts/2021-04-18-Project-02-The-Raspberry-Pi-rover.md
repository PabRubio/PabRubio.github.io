The Raspberry Pi Rover is basically a small robot version of the big rovers that go to mars. It's a simple project but takes time and dedication, but once it's finished you can have your own little rover to control wherever you want to. Let's get right into how to make it...

I made this rover using 'Monk Makes RasPiRobot Rover Kit' which I recommmend getting to do the project, but anyways here is the list of things you get in the kit.

### Things you'll need:

- Raspberry Pi

### How to make it

Once you have all the parts, the rest is simple, just follow the steps in the booklet to assemble the rover and then using the command line you can control it. After you have the rover finished you can add extra bits to it like a button, lights or even a camera. Once finished it should look a bit like mine...
