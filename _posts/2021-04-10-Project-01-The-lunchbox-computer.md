The Lunchbox Computer is basically a Raspberry Pi computer in a lunchbox, so you can go around with it and no one will ever know your secret, perfect for all the hackers out there that want an ideal place to hide their computers to take to places where computers are not allowed. Let's get right into how to make it...

### Things you'll need:

### How to make it

Once you have all the pieces the rest is easy, all you have to do is using foam tape place the parts in the lunchbox, connect the cables and just like that you should have your finished Lunchbox Computer, it should look a bit like mine...
