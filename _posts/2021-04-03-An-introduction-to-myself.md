Hello, my name is Pablo Rubio Punal and I am 12 years old. I have just started learning to code and this blog is going to show you my adventure, on this first post I am just going to give you a short introduction to myself, Pablo. I  was born in England along with my brother, Adrian, and my sister, Lara, but the rest of my family are from Spain so we often go there to visit them, I have many friends in both countries so I am happy. Some of my favourite hobbies include coding, gaming, doing sport, playing piano and many, many more. My favourite sport is football and my favourite color is red. So I hope you enjoyed this first post and I will see you later. Goodbye!!!
